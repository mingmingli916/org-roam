#+title: Frame Type

A *frame* is a screen area that contains one or more Emacs windows; we
also use the term *frame* to refer to the Lisp object that Emacs uses to
refer to the screen area.

Frames have no read syntax. They print in hash notation, giving the
frame's title, plus its address in core (useful to identify the frame
uniquely).

#+begin_example
(selected-frame)                        ; #<frame *scratch* 0x7fdcdc0e2630>
#+end_example
