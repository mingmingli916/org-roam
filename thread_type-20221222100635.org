#+title: Thread Type

A *thread* in Emacs represents a separate thread of Emacs Lisp
execution. It runs its own Lisp program, has its own current buffer, and
can have subprocesses locked to it, i.e. subprocesses whose output only
this thread can accept.

Thread objects have no read syntax. They print in hash notation, giving
the name of the thread (if it has been given a name) or its address in
core:

#+begin_example
(all-threads)                           ; (#<thread 0x10b588b80>)
#+end_example
