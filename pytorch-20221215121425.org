* Automatic Differentiation

[[file:~/note/org-roam/code/automatic_differentiation.py]]

In practice, based on our designed model the system builds a computational graph, tracking which data combined through which operations to produce the output.
Automatic differentiation enables the system to subsequently backpropagate gradients.
Here, backpropagate simply means to trace through the computational graph, filling in the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter.


* Probability
