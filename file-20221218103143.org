** Backup Files
The first time you save a file during an editing session, Emacs creates a backup file.
The name of the backup file is the same as the name of the file youâ€™re editing, with a tilde ~ added.
For example, if you are editing the file text, the backup file is text~

** Auto-save Files
Emacs will auto save you files from time to time into auto-save files.
The name of an auto-save file is the same as the name of the file you are editing, with a sharp (#) added to the beginning and the end.
For example, if you are editing the file text, its auto-save file is #text#.

* Linux Files

A file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less.
Every I/O device, including disks, keyboards, displays, and even networks, is modeled as a file.
This simple and elegant notion of a file is nonetheless very powerful because it provides applications with a uniform view of all the varied I/O devices that might be contained in the system.


* Text File and Binary File
Files that consists exclusively of ASCII characters are known as text files.
All other files are knowns as binary files.
