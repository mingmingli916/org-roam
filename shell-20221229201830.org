On UNIX system, the program used to interpret and manage commands was referred to as the shell.
The shell is command language interpreter.



* Using Shell Variables
The shell itself stores information that may be useful to the user's shell session in what are called variables.

A subset of your local variables are referred to as environment variables.
Environment variables are variables that are exported to any new shells opened from the current shell.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
set #  see all variables
env # see environment variables
declare # a list of the current enviroment variables
#+END_SRC


* Creating Your Shell Environment
You can tune your shell to help you work more efficiently.

** Configuring your shell (important and useful)
Bash Configuration Files
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|File                |Description                                       |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|/etc/profile        |This sets up user environment for every user. It  |
|                    |is executed when you first log in.                |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|/etc/bashrc         |This executed for every user who runs the bash    |
|                    |shell, each time a bash shell is opened. Values in|
|                    |this file can be overridden by information in each|
|                    |user's ~/.bashrc file.                            |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|~/.bash_profile     |This is used by each user to enter information    |
|                    |that is specific to his or her use of the shell.  |
|                    |It is executed only once, when the user logs in.  |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|~/.bashrc           |This contains the information that is specific to |
|                    |your bash shells. It is read when you log in and  |
|                    |also each time you open a new bash shell.         |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|./bash_logout       |This executes each time you log out.              |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

** Setting your prompt
Your prompt consists of a set of characters that appear each time the shell is ready to accept a command.
The PS1 environment variable sets what the prompt contains and is what you interact with most of the time.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
man PS1 
#+END_SRC

** Adding environment variables
If you often use directories of commands that are not in your path, you can permanently add them. (PATH)
