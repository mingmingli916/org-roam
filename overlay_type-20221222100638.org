#+title: Overlay Type

An *overlay* specifies properties that apply to a part of a buffer. Each
overlay applies to a specified range of the buffer, and contains a
property list (a list whose elements are alternating property names and
values). Overlay properties are used to present parts of the buffer
temporarily in a different display style. (narrowing)

Overlays have no read syntax, and print in hash notation, giving the
buffer name and range of positions.

#+begin_example
(setq foo (make-overlay 1 10)) ; #<overlay from 1 to 10 in scratch.el>
#+end_example
