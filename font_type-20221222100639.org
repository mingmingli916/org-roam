#+title: Font Type

A *font* specifies how to display text on a graphical terminal. There
are actually three separate font types --- *font objects*, *font specs*,
and *font entities* --- each of which has slightly different properties.
None of them have a read syntax; their print syntax looks like =#=, =#=,
and =#= respectively.
