OS: operating system

OS acts as the interface between the user and the computer hardware.

The common OS are:
- [[id:2B05F589-799B-4F88-A295-3851E0DD5AFB][Linux]]
- [[id:A65F0AA3-AEF6-428C-A2C9-D04EA72B1EA3][Windows]]
- [[id:40936EE0-F4B9-4F62-A4FC-123422EC5DA0][MacOS]]
  

Linux and MacOS are [[id:D4D89744-7B69-4BFA-B096-73C6ECDC7271][Unix]]-like operating system.  

There are different between [[id:9EAEE46D-79B4-4B78-A8D7-AD00DD643FF9][System Software]] and OS:

| Definition    | System software is the software that manages the resources and allows a user to interact with the system. | The operating system acts as the interface between the application program and the computer hardware. |
| Memory        | It loads in the main memory whenever required.                                                            | It resides in the main memory all the time while the system is on.                                    |
| Memory Manage | It manages the system.                                                                                    | It manages the system and system software.                                                            |
| Execution     | It runs only when required.                                                                               | It runs all the time.                                                                                 |

The operating system has two primary purposes:
- to protect the hardware from misuse by runnaway application 
- to provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisums for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices

The operating system achieves both goals via the fundarmental abstractions: process, virtual memory, and files.
