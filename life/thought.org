This thought is important especially in programming.
There is one common mistake that I often made.
The mistake is that I want to program a project perfectly.
When I think up something new I will change the project.
This makes the project almost uncompleted.

You can program a version I project that may be simple.
Then you can refactor it afterward to get a better project that called version II.
