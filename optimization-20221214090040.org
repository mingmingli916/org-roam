The goal of optimization is to use data to adjust the parameters in model.
That is to say, the optimizing process is the process of learning.


But what do we mean by learning?
Mitchell provides a succinct definition:
``A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$''
Now, how does the learn happen?

Thought this process, the model improves its performance at tasks.
