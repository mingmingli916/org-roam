#+title: Byte-Code Function Type

Byte-code function objects* are produced by byte-compiling Lisp code.
Internally, a byte-code function object is much like a vector; however,
the evaluator handles this data type specially when it appears in a
function call. The printed representation and read syntax for a
byte-code function object is like that for a vector, with an additional
=#= before the opening =[= (i.e. start with =#[=).
