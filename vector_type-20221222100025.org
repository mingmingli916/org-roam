#+title: Vector Type

The printed representation of a vector consists of a left square
bracket, the elements, and a right square bracket. This is also the read
syntax. Like numbers and strings, vectors are considered constants for
evaluation.

#+begin_example
[1 "two" (three)]                       ; A vector of three elements.
#+end_example
