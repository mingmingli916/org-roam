#+title: Primitive Function Type

A *primitive function* is a function callable from Lisp but written in
the C programming language. Primitive functions are also called *subrs*
or *built-in functions*. (The word "subr" is derived from "subroutine".)
Most primitive functions evaluate all their arguments when they are
called. A primitive function that does not evaluate all its arguments is
called a *special form*.

Primitive functions have no read syntax and print in hash notation with
the name of the subroutine.

#+begin_example
;; symbol-function: access the function cell of the symbol
(symbol-function 'car)                  ; #<subr car>
;; To check if it is a primitive function.
(subrp (symbol-function 'car))          ; t
#+end_example
