#+title: Mutex Type

A *mutex* is an exclusive lock that threads can own and disown, in order
to synchronize between them.

Mutex objects have no read syntax. They print in hash notation, giving
the name of the mutex (if it has been given a name) or its address in
core:

#+begin_example
(make-mutex "my-mutex")                 ; #<mutex my-mutex>
(make-mutex)                            ; #<mutex 0x7fdcdf9deb60>
#+end_example
