#+title: Frame Configuration Type

A *frame configuration* stores information about the positions, sizes,
and contents of the windows in all frames. It is not a primitive type.
It is actually a list whose car is =frame-configuration= and whose cdr
is an alist. Each alist element describes one frame, which appears as
the car of that element.
