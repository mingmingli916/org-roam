We train model on training data but use test data (not used to train the model) to test out model.
The ability to perform on test data is called *generalization*.
We can use model on test data because we assume that the train data and the test has the same probability distribution (i.e. they have relationship).


*Regularization* is any modification we make to a learnining algorithm that is intended to reduce its generalization error.


Machine learning algorithm will generally perform best when their [[id:4487C2B2-FB61-47B9-9315-DEC565AABA75][Capacity]] is appropriate for the true complexity of the task and the amount of training data.
