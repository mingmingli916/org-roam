#+title: Pooling



A pooling function replaces the output of the net at a certain location with a summary statistic of the nearby outputs.
For example, the max pooling oeration reports the maximum output within a rectangular neighborhood.
Pooling helps to make the representation approximately invariant to small translations of the input.
Invariant to translation means that if we translate the input by a small amount, the values of most of the pooled outputs do not change.

The following formula can be used to calculate the output dimension.
\begin{gather}
  h_{o} = \frac{h_{i} - h_{k}}{h_{s}} + 1\\
  w_{o} = \frac{w_{i} - w_{k}}{w_{s}} + 1
\end{gather}
where \(h_{o}\) is the output height, \(h_{i}\) is the input height, \(h_{k}\) is the pooling height, \(h_{s}\) is the stride height, \(w_{o}\) is the output width, \(w_{i}\) is the input width, \(w_{k}\) is the pooling width, \(w_{s}\) is the stride width.
