* Basic Keyboard Use
** Base, Multi-Layer Layout
The Advantage360 Pro is a multi-layer keyboard which means that each physical key on the keyboard can perform multiple actions.
The default layout features 3 easily accessible layers: The primary “Base Layer”, and two secondary layers (“Fn” and “Keypad”) which offer auxiliary key actions.

Each Layer is color coded and indicated by the right most LED on each module:
• Base: Off
• Kp: White
• Fn: Blue
• Mod: Green

** Disable Indicator LEDs
If you find the indicator LEDs annoying, not useful, or want to maximize battery life you can disable all indicator LEDs with the shortcut Mod + Space.


** Adjust backlighting
The Pro features 5 levels of brightness and Off.
Using the backlight will significantly affect battery life so we recommend disabling the backlight except when needed.
To adjust the backlight up or down through the 6 levels, hold the Mod key and tap either set of arrow keys (Up/Left to increase and Down/Right to decrease).
You can also quickly toggle backlighting on/off using the shortcut Mod + Delete, or Mod + Enter.



** Toggling between the 5 Profiles
The Pro can be paired with up to 5 different Bluetooth enabled devices.
Use the shortcut Mod + 1-5 to toggle between the 5 Profiles to pair from scratch or reconnect with a previously paired device.
- Profile 1: White
- Profile 2: Blue
- Profile 3: Red
- Profile 4: Green
- Profile 5: Off (Use this profile for maximum battery life)

** Building Firmware
Anytime you “Commit Changes” you can navigate to the Actions tab in your Adv360 ZMK Repo where you will see a new workflow entitled “Updated Keymap”.
GitHub will automatically build a new set of left and right keyboard firmware files with your custom layout.
The yellow dot indicates the build is in progress.
Each build will take several minutes so be patient.Once the build is complete, the yellow dot will turn green.
Click the “Updated keymap” link to load the build page and then click “firmware” to download both the left and right firmware files to your PC.

** Firmware Update Process
1. Obtain the desired Advantage360 Pro firmware update files (“.uf2” files) from GitHub (Note: There are separate Left and Right versions so be sure to install them on the correct modules)
2. Connect the left module to your PC using the included cable
3. Then place the left module into bootloader mode using a paperclip to DOUBLE-CLICK on the Reset Button (Important Note: keystrokes on the keyboard are disabled while in bootloader).
4. Copy and paste the left.uf2 firmware update file to the removable “Adv360 Pro” drive on your PC
5. The keyboard will automatically install the file and disconnect the removable drive. DO NOT DISCONNECT THE KEYBOARD UNTIL THE “ADV360 PRO” DRIVE EJECTS ITSELF.
6. Now connect the right module to your PC and place the right module into bootloader mode using its Reset Button
7. Copy and paste the right.uf2 firmware update file to the removable “Adv360 Pro” drive on your PC
8. The keyboard will automatically install the file and disconnect the removable drive.
9. Once both sides have been updated you are ready to go. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF FIRMWARE ON THE MODULES.
