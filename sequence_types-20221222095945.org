#+title: Sequence Types



A *sequence* is a Lisp object that represents an ordered set of
elements. There are two kinds of sequence in Emacs Lisp: [[id:AC5D120C-7EE7-4F90-9782-6B48ECCCBEB3][List Types]] and [[id:59D49734-498A-4282-9814-AC22B1D5A2EB][Array Type]].



It is generally impossible to read the same sequence twice, since
sequences are always created a new upon reading. If you read the read
syntax for a sequence twice, you get two sequences with equal contents.
There is one exception: the empty list () always stands for the same
object, =nil=.
