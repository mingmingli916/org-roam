#+title: Org List

Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

- Unordered list items start with *-, +* or *** as bullets.

- Ordered list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or
  a right parenthesis, such as *1.* or *1)*. If you want a list to start
  with a different value --- e.g., 10 --- start the text of the item
  with *[@10]*

- Description list items are unordered list items, and contain the
  separator *::* to distinguish the description term from the
  description.

The following commands act on items when point is in the first line of
an item---the line with the bullet or number. Some of them imply the
application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact. If some of
these actions get in your way, configure =org-list-automatic-rules= to
disable them individually.

* Checkboxes

Every item in a plain list can be made into a checkbox by starting it
with the string *[ ]*. This feature is similar to TODO items, but is
more lightweight. Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list,
so they are often great to split a task into a number of simple steps.

#+BEGIN_SRC
  * light task [25%]
    - [-] task 1 [33%]
      - [X] task 1-1
      - [ ] task 1-2
      - [ ] task 1-3
    - [X] task 2
    - [ ] task 3
    - [ ] task 4
#+END_SRC

You can use *C-c C-c* to toggle the checkbox checked or not.
You can insert new list item with checkbox with the command *M-S-RET*.
