#+title: Macro Type

A *Lisp macro* is a user-defined construct that extends the Lisp
language. It is represented as an object much like a function, but with
different argument-passing semantics. A Lisp macro has the form of a
list whose first element is the symbol =macro= and whose cdr is a Lisp
function object, including the =lambda= symbol.

Lisp macro objects are usually defined with the built-in =defmacro=
macro, but any list that begins with =macro= is a macro as far as Emacs
is concerned.
