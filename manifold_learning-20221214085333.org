A manifold is an important concept in mathematics.
In laymanâ€™s terms, you can think of it as a surface of any shape.

You can get a visual impression with the images on google:

Manifold Learning convert high dimension features into low dimension features (with useful features only, dropping some unimportant features).
We suppose there is a connected manifold space that is what we want to model to learn.
For example, human face manifold space.
