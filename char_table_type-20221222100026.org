#+title: Char-Table Type


Char-tables have certain extra features to make them more useful for
many jobs that involve assigning information to character codes --- for
example, a char-table can have a parent to inherit from, a default
value, and a small number of extra slots to use for special purposes. A
char-table can also specify a single value for a whole character set.

The printed representation of a char-table is like a vector except that
there is an extra *#^* at the beginning.
