#+title: Buffer

[[id:EC9FFD12-C7A7-4F78-93B0-84E9596517F6][Cache Thought]]

In Emacs, you don't really edit _files_ (stored on disk).
Instead, Emacs copies the content of a file into a temporary _buffer_ and you edit that.
The file on disk doesn't change until you save the buffer.


Buffers are independent of windows and frames.
A Buffer may contains a file or be Emacs-generated.
The name of the buffer that containing a file is the same name with the file.
The name of the buffer that are Emacs-generated has the format _\ast{}buffer name\ast{}_.
For example, _\ast{}Help\ast{}, \ast{}scratch\ast{}, \ast{}Messages\ast{}_ as so on.
