*Virtual memory* is an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that it has exclusive use of the main memory.
Each process has the same uniform view of memory, which is known as its *virtual address space*.
The virtual address space for [[id:2B05F589-799B-4F88-A295-3851E0DD5AFB][Linux]] processes is shown in the following figure
