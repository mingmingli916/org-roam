#+title: Condition Variable Type

A *condition variable* is a device for a more complex thread
synchronization than the one supported by a mutex. A thread can wait on
a condition variable, to be woken up when some other thread notifies the
condition.

Condition variable objects have no read syntax. They print in hash
notation, giving the name of the condition variable (if it has been
given a name) or its address in core:

#+begin_example
(make-condition-variable (make-mutex))  ; #<condvar 0x7fdcdfd33980>
#+end_example
