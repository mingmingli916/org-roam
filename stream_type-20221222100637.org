#+title: Stream Type

A *stream* is an object that can be used as a source or sink for
characters --- either to supply characters for input or to accept them
as output. Many different types can be used this way: markers, buffers,
strings, and functions. Most often, input streams (character sources)
obtain characters from the keyboard, a buffer, or a file, and output
streams (character sinks) send characters to a buffer, such as a *Help*
buffer, or to the echo area.

The object =nil=, in addition to its other meanings, may be used as a
stream. It stands for the value of the variable =standard-input= or
=standard-output=. Also, the object =t= as a stream specifies input
using the minibuffer or output in the echo area.

Streams have no special printed representation or read syntax, and print
as whatever primitive type they are.
