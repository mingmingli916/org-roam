A fully connected neural network (also called MLP) consists of a series of fully connected
layers that connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the
other layer. Full connected neural network layers use matrix
multiplication by a matrix of parameters with a separate parameter
describing the interaction between each input unit and each output unit.
This means that every output unit interacts with every input unit.

The following figure the full connects neural network.
