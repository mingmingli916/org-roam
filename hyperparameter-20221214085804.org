#+title: Hyperparameter


*Hyperparameters* are parameters used to control the algorithm's behavior but can or should not be learned by the learning algorithm.
It can affect the [[id:4487C2B2-FB61-47B9-9315-DEC565AABA75][Capacity]] of the model.
So if these parameter can be learned, it will always choose the parameters that makes the [[id:4487C2B2-FB61-47B9-9315-DEC565AABA75][Capacity]] largest.


In practice, we usually split training data into two disjoint subsets: training set and validation set (generally, 8:2).
The validation set is used to adjust the hyperparameters.
